# Image Steganography MSB Technique
A Steganography is a technique in which we hide messages into other sources of information, like text/documents, audios, videos and images etc., so that it not visible to the other users or technically to unauthorized users.  A Steganography system is made up of three components: cover-object means which hides the plaintext or hidden message, and the stego-object means which is the cover object with message embedded inside it (here it is an image). A digital image is represented by using a 2-D matrix of the color intestines at each grid points.  The gray images use 8 bits, whereas colored utilizes 24 bits to describe the color model, such as RGB model as it has 3 channels R, G, B. Taking the cover object as image in steganography is called image steganography. In this   technique   pixel   intensities   are   used   to   hide   the information.
As in here we are using MSB algorithm, so the Most Significant Bit of the color intensities at each grid point will be replaced by the message bit (When the text/ hidden message will be converted into bit stream).  A simplified steganographic process is shown in figure.
